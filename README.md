# CFC PvP Movespeed
Adjusts player movespeed based on how many SWEPs are equipped

# Overview 
A Garry's Mod addon that adjusts players movement speed based on the amount of weapons they have equiped. This was done to discourage carrying large amount of weapons at one time.  
This addons also adds commands that allow players to remove and drop their weapons.

# Changing weapon weights 
All weapons have a weight of `1` by default, you can change this default weight by adding your weapon to the weaponWeights table
in [lua/autorun/server/sv_pvp_movespeed.lua](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/cfc_pvp_movespeed/blob/master/lua/autorun/server/sv_pvp_movespeed.lua)


### Weight calculations
A players weight is the weight of all their weapons added together. This number is passed to the function `movementMultiplier`  in 
[lua/autorun/server/sv_pvp_movespeed.lua](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/cfc_pvp_movespeed/blob/master/lua/autorun/server/sv_pvp_movespeed.lua) 
to calculate a movement speed multiplier

# Chat Commands
- `/dropall` deletes all weapons from the players inventory and resets their movespeed.
  - Can also be ran via the `cfc_dropallweapons` concmd.
- `/drop` drop the held weapon on the ground where it can be picked up again or it will despawn after 10 seconds.
  - Can also be ran via the `cfc_dropweapon` concmd.
- Chat command aliases can be modified in [lua/autorun/server/sv_commands.lua](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/cfc_pvp_movespeed/blob/master/lua/autorun/server/sv_commands.lua)

# Setup
Clone the addon into your gmod servers addon directory 

# Compatibility / Added Functions
- Other addons that use `:SetRunSpeed()` or `:SetWalkSpeed()` will automatically be accounted for, setting the player's base run/walk speeds.
  - The original, unwrapped functions can be found in `pvpMoveSpeed.wrappedFuncs.Player`
  - Note that [the config](https://github.com/CFC-Servers/cfc_pvp_movespeed/blob/master/lua/autorun/server/sv_pvp_movespeed.lua) sets minimum walk and run speeds, so you'll need to use the **unwrapped** `:Set___Speed()` functions if you want to force someone's speed to 0. The player's speed will revert once they equip/drop weapons when using this method, however.
    - *(TODO: Once the naming scheme is resolved and the config is globalized, the above quirk can be trivialized. Either by dynamically modifying the min speed, or by adding a utility function that overrides player speed and temporarily disables the weight system on them.)*
- If one of your addons defines `Player:IsInBuild()`, it will be used to disable weapon weights on buildmode players.
- `Player:SetMoveSpeed( runSpeed, walkSpeed )`
  - `runSpeed` - Base run speed to use. (Default: `normalRunSpeed = 400` )
  - `walkSpeed` - Base walk speed to use. (Default: `normalWalkSpeed = 200` )
  - Sets both run and walk speeds at the same time.
- `Player:SetMoveSpeedMultiplier( multiplier )`
  - `multiplier` - Movespeed multiplier to use. (Default: `1`)
  - Sets base run and walk speeds to `normalSpeed * multiplier`
